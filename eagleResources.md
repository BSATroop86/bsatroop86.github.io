- Eagle Recommendation Letters
- The Prospective Eagle Scout should start requesting Letters of Recommendation from 4 different individuals listed on the application as soon as possible. A sample template link is below. Requested references may be returned to the Scout in a sealed envelope or sent to a designated unit adult for safekeeping until the Eagle Board of Review.
- These individuals can be teachers, employers, coaches, etc., from people who know you well. Unfortunately, we cannot take the letters from parents or relatives.
