We canâ€™t emphasize enough how important summer camp is for your sons scouting and life experience. He builds relationships, becomes part of a team, learns independence, is given and we hope learns responsibility, and last but not least has a great time. TMR is a great opportunity for the boys to earn merit badges, work on their rank advancement, but more importantly, have lots of fun. This is a very important week for the boys, and we encourage all scouts to attend.
